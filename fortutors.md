# Becoming a Tutor:

The LRN recruits for tutors in the Spring Semester for the upcoming academic year. Students who meet the minimum qualifications are invited to apply to be a tutor. Applications are available at the LRN. Typically, LRN peer tutors work with students only on those courses they have actually taken and successfully completed at Arcadia. In general, those who are recruited to be tutors are upper-class students who have taken a number of AU courses. The best candidates will be able to tutor a wide range of courses, particularly “high-demand” courses. However, the LRN hires peer tutors who are not only excellent all-round students, but also possess interpersonal abilities, good communication skills, and enthusiasm for their subject areas.

Students who are are interested in becoming a tutor must

1. Complete an application;
2. Receive a recommendation by a member of the faculty. A professor may write you a brief letter, e-mail Linda Pizzi (the Assistant Dean of Academic Development), or provide a signature on the application;
3. Have a B or better in each course you list on your application;
4. Maintain a minimum semester and cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better.

Once completed, the application can be sent to tutor@arcadia.edu or dropped off at the Learning Resource Network Lab in 142 Knight Hall. Applications should be received by mid-March of the Spring semester. Interviews are scheduled in April and May.

# Making Appointments

Tutoring appointments should be made using TutorTrac. Tutors should not make recurring appointments without gaining approval from Linda or Gina. If a tutor would like to make an appointment outside of their typical hours, they must first create availability on the TutorTrac schedule, then enter the appointment. 

# Tutor Responsibilities
After each appointment, tutors must fill out a Tutor Report with information about that session. This form can be found in the shared drive, in a document usually titled with the name of the semester and "important links" (ie: SP 20 IMPORTANT LINKS). Before each semester, tutors must fill out and turn in tutor availability forms and a form with any new courses they are able to tutor. Hard copies of these forms are available in the LRN, and virtual copies are on the shared drive and emailed to tutors.
